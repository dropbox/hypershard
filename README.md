# About
Hypershard is a fast and simple test collector that works on Java and Kotlin source files. Using Hypershard, we are able to send a subset of the tests to separate nodes.

At Dropbox, we run Android UI tests separately from JVM tests. Using historical data, we shard our UI tests such that each shard is balanced e.g. each shard ends approximately at the same time.

We do this by running tests using [ADB Instrumentation test options](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/runner/AndroidJUnitRunner) `-e testFile` where each shard has its own list of tests.
